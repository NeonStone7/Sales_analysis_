**PROBLEM STATEMENT**<BR>
    
  The dataset contains 1559 sales data of ten BigMart stores. The aim is to build  a predictive model that predicts sales so BigMart knows which stores are doing well and understands what properties affect stores. <br>
Several Linear models(Multiple, ridge, lasso, elastic net regression) were used and their RMSE and R2 scores were compared.
